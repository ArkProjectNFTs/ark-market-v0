### The problem

The current landscape for digital asset transactions is fragmented, with multiple entry-points, varying levels of security, and limited liquidity solutions. This makes the process of exchanging NFTs a time-consuming and confusing process for businesses and individuals alike.

### Solution

Genkidama simplifies NFT trading by providing a unified platform for NFT liquidity aggregation. By standardizing the NFT market, aggregating and normalizing orders, and making liquidity available through APIs, the protocol streamlines the NFT trading process.
