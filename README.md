## Overview

### The problem

The current landscape for digital asset transactions is fragmented, with multiple entry-points, varying levels of security, and limited liquidity solutions. This makes the process of exchanging NFTs a time-consuming and confusing process for businesses and individuals alike.

### Solution

Genkidama simplifies NFT trading by providing a unified platform for NFT liquidity aggregation. By standardizing the NFT market, aggregating and normalizing orders, and making liquidity available through APIs, the protocol streamlines the NFT trading process.

### What is the Genkidama protocol?

The Genkidama protocol consists of:

- **Data Model** the Protocol uses a standardized data model for nft exchange, fees, royalties
- **An indexer** that aggregates liquidity from genkidama data model and also other NFT marketplaces that doesn't integrate or respect the protocol
- **An On-chain OrderBook** including royalties normalization and advanced bid features. _In order to achieve sufficient scalability and performance, we are considering using volution mode to store the orderbook and in the future a Layer 3._
- **A set of APIs** to provide access to aggregated liquidity data like price, orders, metadatas enabling interaction with the orderbook.
- **An SDK client** to assist developer teams to execute core functionality (listing, bidding, buying and selling) through an easy-to-use library.
- **A fully customizable whitelabel marketplace demo** and a UI KIT to aid starknet builders in swiftly launching their own customized NFT marketplaces.
