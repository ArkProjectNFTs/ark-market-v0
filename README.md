## Overview

### The problem

The current landscape for digital asset transactions is fragmented, with multiple entry-points, varying levels of security, and limited liquidity solutions. This makes the process of exchanging NFTs a time-consuming and confusing process for businesses and individuals alike.

### Solution

Genkidama simplifies NFT trading by providing a unified platform for NFT liquidity aggregation. By standardizing the NFT market, aggregating and normalizing orders, and making liquidity available through APIs, the protocol streamlines the NFT trading process.

### How does it work?

Users interact with the orderbook of external marketplaces (ie. listing on Mintsquare or Aspect), our indexer captures off-chain events and pushes them on-chain through our orderbook contract, making them accessible to any other application through contract composability.

Genkidama provides Starknet builders with a suite of tools to aid developer teams in swiftly launching customized NFT marketplaces. These solutions include:

- Aggregated Liquidity APIs
- Comprehensive UI kit
- Fully customizable whitelabel marketplace
